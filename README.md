Module Summary
For professionals planning on working with Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) systems, grasping the underlying technologies is crucial, especially for maintaining the security of these sophisticated systems.

This module serves as a dual-purpose resource: an approachable introduction to AI fundamentals and a detailed reference for ongoing learning. It explores the theoretical foundations of AI, building a robust base for mastering the technology's key concepts

While mathematical aspects are explored to add depth, they're not the primary focus. By completing this module, you'll be well-prepared to tackle more advanced, practical topics with confidence.

In this module, we will cover:

Supervised Learning: Foundations of training models using labeled data, including algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.
Unsupervised Learning: Approaches to working with unlabeled data, such as k-means clustering and principal component analysis.
Reinforcement Learning: Frameworks for how agents can make decisions in an environment to maximize rewards, focusing on algorithms like Q-learning and SARSA.
Deep Learning: Underpinnings of neural network architectures, including perceptrons, multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
Generative AI: Concepts behind generative models, including large language models and their underlying mechanisms.
This module focuses entirely on the principles and concepts of AI, ML, and deep learning. It does not include practical exercises or hands-on assessments.

You can start and stop the module at any time and pick up where you left off. There is no time limit or "grading," but you must complete all sections to have this module marked as complete in any paths you have chosen.

The module is classified as "Medium" and assumes a working knowledge of the following topics:

Basic Statistics (recommended)
Linear Algebra (recommended)
Calculus (recommended)
Python Programming Fundamentals
